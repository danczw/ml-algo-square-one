## Development Setup

The project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage the project dependencies. Install dependencies within the respective subfolder via:

    `poetry install`

The entry point for testing the algorithms is the `main.py` file. To run the code, use:

    `poetry run python src/main.py`
